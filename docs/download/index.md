Abundance and density summaries were calculated as described in the BAM National Model technical report ([BAM 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4018335)) using post-hoc binning based on the 2005 Canadian Land Cover layer. 

The following summaries are awailable for download:

- Species abundances in the Ring of Fire region ([CSV file](https://borealbirds.github.io/ring-of-fire/species/rof-abundance.csv))
with estimates and 90% confidence interval (in million individuals)
- Species densities in land cover classes within the Ring of Fire region ([CSV file](https://borealbirds.github.io/ring-of-fire/species/rof-density.csv))
with estimates and 90% confidence interval (in males per ha)
