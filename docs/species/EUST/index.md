<h2>Sturnus vulgaris (<em>&amp;Eacute;tourneau sansonnet</em>)</h2>

The population size of European Starling in the Ring of Fire region was 0.592 (0.41, 0.825) million individuals based on the [BAM National Models](https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4018335).

# Maps

Mean density (males per ha) is the average of 32 bootstrap based prediction maps.

# Density

Mean densities and bootstrap based confidence intervals by land cover type.
Density summaries were calculated using post-hoc binning ([BAM 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4018335)), we used the 2005 Canadian Land Cover layer.
